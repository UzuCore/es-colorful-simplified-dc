      <systemName>Mega Duck</systemName>
      <systemDescription>The Mega Duck, is a fourth generation (1987-2004) handheld developed and distributed by Welback Holdings, but marketed under different names like Creatronic, Videojet, Cougar USA, and Hartung. The Mega Duck was an obvious clone of the Game Boy in looks, and it sadly lacked any innovative games to set it apart to become a competitor.</systemDescription>
