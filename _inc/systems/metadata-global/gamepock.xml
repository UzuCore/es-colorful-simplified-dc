      <systemDescription>The Epoch Game Pocket Computer (Japanese: ゲームポケコン, Hepburn: Gēmupokekon) is a second-generation handheld game console released by Epoch Co. in Japan in 1984 for 12,800 Japanese yen.[1] It is also known as Pokekon and was one of the very few truly[clarification needed] handheld systems to be released in the early 1980s, preceding the Game Boy by 5 years.

The system was a commercial failure in Japan, and as a result, only 5 games were made for it. A puzzle game and a paint program were built into the system. It was powered by 4 AA batteries, and screen's contrast could be adjusted by the user. Input and output controls included four buttons, an 8-way joypad, a contrast dial, and a sound on-off switch.</systemDescription>
