      <systemName>Cannonball OutRun Engine</systemName>
      <systemDescription>CannonBall is an souped up game engine for the OutRun arcade game. The original 68000 and Z80 assembler code has been rewritten in C++. This makes it possible to make improvements suitable for modern platforms, including a higher frame-rate and widescreen support. It requires the original ROMs, as these contain elements including the graphics and audio data.</systemDescription>
